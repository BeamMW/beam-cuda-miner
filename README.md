# beam-cuda-miner

Team Beam commissioned another open source free CUDA miner (in addition to OpenCL and the cuda miner that were already releaed), that is still in development by Evgeniy Pochitaev from GMiner's developers team (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5034735.0). We will release it when it will be ready. We are doing every effort to support and welcome the miners community to easily and hassle free mine Beam.
